Citibike Data Analysis

The analysis of the citibake data included transformation of the initial data using Pandas and development of an analytical executive dashboard using Tableau application. 

The key objective of the executive dashboard is to provide key executive metrics to help interpret the success of the programme.

For the purpose of this exercise the success of the programme is manifested in to key executive questions/decision:

1) how to sustain growth by investing in further expansion and popularization of the programme, and
2) what improvements are needed to popularize the programme. 

The analysis of the first question was based on the 3-year historic data (2018-2020). Key metrics included the usage by key customer segments and demographics (age, gender). The data revealed the following key takeaways:

- Despite a slight decrease in usage in 2020, which might have been attributed to COVID 19 pandemic and related restrictions, overall, for the past three year there is an upward trend among both customers and subscribers (members) groups 
- Casual users (customers) grow faster compared to subscribers (members). While this may be common for as the programme is still maturing, more focus and resources should be not devoted to develop effective marketing and sales strategies to turn existing customers into subscribers. 
- The activity is cyclical with lower usage during winter months and higher activity during warmer period. This suggest that resources should be planned accordingly to ensure. Other strategies may also be considered to increase usage during the winter months, such as special discounts for new members and casual customers, partnership with retailers and public transport, etc. 
- The usage by males is more than double compared to usage by females. A further analysis is recommended to be carried out to understand motivations and needs of each gender segment 
- Majority of the users are between 25-35 years old. However, it seems like the data is not accurate and might be skewed, as there is a high number of outliers, suggesting that not all users provide an accurate data. 

The second questions were based on the analysis of the most recent data (Q2 2021) and aimed at more detailed analysis of how much time different user groups spend on a single ride and whether there is a potential for further improvements and growth. The key takeaways of this analysis include:

- Casual customers spent on average twice as much time riding compared to members. The data also shows that on average 4/5 of all casual riders spent slightly less than 30 minutes, thus not paying addition fees. 1/5 of casual customers, however, did spend more than 30 minutes. A further assessment needs to be undertaken to determine whether increasing the threshold for casual customers would result in increase in customers and revenue, especially during weekday or weekends. A dynamic pricing strategies may also be considered to manage the demand and sales over more popular weekends and less popular weekdays.
- Interestingly for member, the average time used is much less an allocated 45 min threshold, which may suggest that members may value other benefits more. 

Furthermore, the data revealed that Manhattan was the most popular area in relation to buke usage, and suggested that further strategies need to be adopted to develop less popular areas. 

Data limitations are:
- inconsistent and inaccurate data, for example age.
- limited capacity of the Tableau public account in terms of the number of records
